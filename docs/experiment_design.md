# Experiment Design: Short Form Video Narrative Perceptions

## Research Question
How do people perceive and evaluate narratives in short form videos, and what factors influence these perceptions?

## Experimental Design

### Overview
- **Design**: Between-subjects randomized experiment
- **Participants**: [To be determined] participants
- **Stimuli**: 40 short form videos (randomly selected from a larger pool)
- **Procedure**: Each participant watches 4 randomly selected videos and provides ratings

### Video Selection
- **Total Pool**: 40 short form videos
- **Duration**: Videos range from [X] to [Y] seconds
- **Categories**: Videos span multiple genres/categories to ensure diversity
- **Selection Criteria**: 
  - Clear narrative structure
  - Varied complexity levels
  - Different emotional tones
  - Representative of popular short form content

### Participant Selection
- **Target Population**: [Demographic criteria]
- **Sample Size**: [To be calculated based on power analysis]
- **Recruitment**: [Method of recruitment]
- **Inclusion Criteria**: 
  - Age 18+
  - Regular short form video consumption
  - Informed consent

### Experimental Procedure
1. **Consent and Demographics**: Participants complete informed consent and demographic questionnaire
2. **Video Viewing**: Participants watch 4 randomly assigned videos
3. **Rating Task**: After each video, participants complete narrative perception ratings
4. **Debriefing**: Participants are debriefed about the study purpose

## Measures

### Primary Measures
1. **Narrative Clarity**: How clear and understandable is the narrative?
2. **Emotional Impact**: How emotionally engaging is the video?
3. **Story Coherence**: How well-structured and coherent is the story?
4. **Engagement**: How engaging and compelling is the overall experience?
5. **Narrative Complexity**: How complex or simple is the narrative structure?

### Rating Scale
- **Scale**: 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree)
- **Presentation**: Ratings collected immediately after each video
- **Randomization**: Order of rating questions randomized to avoid order effects

### Demographic Measures
- Age
- Gender
- Education level
- Frequency of short form video consumption
- Preferred video platforms
- Media literacy self-assessment

## Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis
H1: There will be significant differences in narrative perception ratings across different video types/categories.

### Secondary Hypotheses
H2: Individual differences in demographics will predict narrative perception ratings.
H3: Video characteristics (duration, complexity) will influence narrative perception ratings.
H4: There will be consistent patterns in how different narrative elements are perceived across videos.

## Data Analysis Plan

### Descriptive Analysis
- Distribution of ratings across all measures
- Participant demographic characteristics
- Video-level descriptive statistics

### Inferential Analysis
- ANOVA for group differences across video categories
- Correlation analysis between demographic factors and ratings
- Regression analysis to predict narrative perceptions
- Cluster analysis to identify video types based on perception patterns

### Exploratory Analysis
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of narrative perception measures
- Visualization of rating patterns across videos and participants
- Identification of outlier responses or videos

## Ethical Considerations

### Informed Consent
- Clear explanation of study purpose and procedures
- Voluntary participation with right to withdraw
- Data confidentiality and anonymization

### Data Protection
- Secure storage of participant data
- Anonymization of personal identifiers
- Compliance with relevant data protection regulations

### Risk Assessment
- Minimal risk to participants
- No sensitive or distressing content in videos
- Opportunity for debriefing and questions

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Video selection and preparation (Week 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Participant recruitment and data collection (Week 3-6)
- **Phase 3**: Data cleaning and preparation (Week 7)
- **Phase 4**: Data analysis and interpretation (Week 8-10)
- **Phase 5**: Report writing and dissemination (Week 11-12)

## Resources Required

### Materials
- 40 short form videos (selected and prepared)
- Survey platform for data collection
- Computer/tablet for video viewing

### Personnel
- Principal investigator
- Research assistants (if needed)
- Statistical consultant (if needed)

### Budget
- Participant compensation
- Video licensing (if applicable)
- Software licenses
- Equipment costs
