# Experiment Design: Short Form Video Narrative Perceptions

## Research Question
How do people perceive and evaluate narratives in short form videos, and what factors influence these perceptions?

## Experimental Design

### Overview (Sample Data Results)
- **Design**: Between-subjects randomized experiment
- **Participants**: 122 participants successfully recruited
- **Stimuli**: 40 short form videos representing diverse content types
- **Procedure**: Each participant watched 4 randomly selected videos and provided ratings
- **Data Collection Period**: September 25 - October 7, 2025 (12 days)
- **Total Responses**: 488 video ratings (122 participants × 4 videos each)

### Video Selection
- **Total Pool**: 40 short form videos
- **Duration**: Videos range from [X] to [Y] seconds
- **Categories**: Videos span multiple genres/categories to ensure diversity
- **Selection Criteria**: 
  - Clear narrative structure
  - Varied complexity levels
  - Different emotional tones
  - Representative of popular short form content

### Participant Selection (Sample Data Results)
- **Target Population**: General population with internet access
- **Sample Size**: 122 participants successfully recruited
- **Recruitment**: Online recruitment through survey platform
- **Inclusion Criteria**: 
  - Age 18+
  - Internet access for video viewing
  - Informed consent
  - Complete survey participation
- **Language**: All participants used English interface (UserLanguage = 'EN')
- **Session Duration**: Mean 34.7 ± 110.1 minutes (median: 18.9 minutes)

### Experimental Procedure
1. **Consent and Demographics**: Participants complete informed consent and demographic questionnaire
2. **Video Viewing**: Participants watch 4 randomly assigned videos
3. **Rating Task**: After each video, participants complete narrative perception ratings
4. **Debriefing**: Participants are debriefed about the study purpose

## Measures (Sample Data Implementation)

### Primary Measures (28 Total Variables)
1. **Timing Variables (4)**: First click, last click, page submit timing, click count
2. **Familiarity Variables (3)**: Prior exposure, plot familiarity, character familiarity
3. **Comprehension Variables (5)**: Starting point clarity, context inference, interest building, outcome clarity, logical flow
4. **Tension Variables (5)**: Beginning/middle/end tension levels, tension introduction, tension resolution
5. **Resolution Variables (5)**: Narrative resolution presence, satisfaction, scene conclusion, episode/season position
6. **Future Behavior Variables (6)**: Desire for next story, broader context, full episode, comments, comment purpose

### Rating Scales (Sample Data Results)
- **Likert Scales**: 1-7 point scales (Strongly disagree to Strongly agree)
- **Numeric Scales**: 0-100 point scales for tension ratings
- **Binary Scales**: Yes/No responses for resolution questions
- **Categorical Scales**: Multiple choice for episode position, comment purposes
- **Timing Measures**: Continuous numeric data in seconds
- **Presentation**: Ratings collected immediately after each video viewing
- **Response Patterns**: "Somewhat agree" most common for comprehension measures

### Demographic Measures
- Age
- Gender
- Education level
- Frequency of short form video consumption
- Preferred video platforms
- Media literacy self-assessment

## Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis
H1: There will be significant differences in narrative perception ratings across different video types/categories.

### Secondary Hypotheses
H2: Individual differences in demographics will predict narrative perception ratings.
H3: Video characteristics (duration, complexity) will influence narrative perception ratings.
H4: There will be consistent patterns in how different narrative elements are perceived across videos.

## Data Analysis Plan

### Descriptive Analysis
- Distribution of ratings across all measures
- Participant demographic characteristics
- Video-level descriptive statistics

### Inferential Analysis
- ANOVA for group differences across video categories
- Correlation analysis between demographic factors and ratings
- Regression analysis to predict narrative perceptions
- Cluster analysis to identify video types based on perception patterns

### Exploratory Analysis
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of narrative perception measures
- Visualization of rating patterns across videos and participants
- Identification of outlier responses or videos

## Ethical Considerations

### Informed Consent
- Clear explanation of study purpose and procedures
- Voluntary participation with right to withdraw
- Data confidentiality and anonymization

### Data Protection
- Secure storage of participant data
- Anonymization of personal identifiers
- Compliance with relevant data protection regulations

### Risk Assessment
- Minimal risk to participants
- No sensitive or distressing content in videos
- Opportunity for debriefing and questions

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Video selection and preparation (Week 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Participant recruitment and data collection (Week 3-6)
- **Phase 3**: Data cleaning and preparation (Week 7)
- **Phase 4**: Data analysis and interpretation (Week 8-10)
- **Phase 5**: Report writing and dissemination (Week 11-12)

## Resources Required

### Materials
- 40 short form videos (selected and prepared)
- Survey platform for data collection
- Computer/tablet for video viewing

### Personnel
- Principal investigator
- Research assistants (if needed)
- Statistical consultant (if needed)

### Budget
- Participant compensation
- Video licensing (if applicable)
- Software licenses
- Equipment costs
