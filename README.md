# Short Form Video Narrative Perception Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains the data analysis for an experiment investigating people's narrative perceptions of short form videos. The study examines how individuals perceive and evaluate narrative elements in short-form video content, with the goal of understanding the psychological factors that influence narrative comprehension and engagement.

## Experiment Design (Sample Data)

> **Note**: This repository contains analysis of sample data from an ongoing study. Results are preliminary and for demonstration purposes.

- **Participants**: 122 participants recruited for the study
- **Videos**: 40 short form videos representing diverse content types
- **Procedure**: Each participant watched 4 randomly selected videos and provided narrative perception ratings
- **Total Responses**: 488 video ratings (122 participants Ã— 4 videos each)
- **Data Collection Period**: September 25 - October 7, 2025 (12 days)
- **Measures**: Comprehensive ratings on timing, familiarity, comprehension, tension, resolution, and future behavior
